# Automaton-Project

In this project we'll be developing a Turing Machine to convert unary numbers to binary numbers, and use this machine
to encode string characters into binary numbers. In order to do this, we will use its corresponding decimal number in the ASCII table
and encode this decimal number in binary using a Turing Machine previously defined.

In this repository you will find a TuringMachine class already implemented, to build and run any configuration, you just need to 
define each of the transitions and finally validate a given string.
